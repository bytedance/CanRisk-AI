## Rating Process
### Phase 1: Preliminary Screening
```python
# Pseudocode: Literature Eligibility Check
def pre_screening(study):
    exclusion_criteria = {
        'design_flaws': ['cross-sectional', 'traditional case-control', 'mechanistic study'],
        'data_flaws': ['OR value only', 'no confidence interval', 'p-value reporting only']
    }
    return not any(feat in study for feat in exclusion_criteria.values())
```

### Phase 2: Core Assessment
**Step 1 | Study Type Anchoring**  
```markdown
1. RCT studies: Need to verify CONSORT statement elements (allocation concealment/blinding implementation)
2. Observational studies: Use ROBINS-I tool to assess 7 bias domains (model simulation assessment required if necessary)
- Key checks: Confounding control (item 3.1)/exposure measurement (item 2.1)/loss to follow-up bias (item 5.1)
```

**Step 2 | Effect Size Appropriateness**  
```markdown
1. Priority: HR ≈ RR > SIR  
2. Special handling: OR defined by exposure group needs conversion to approximate RR (Formula: RR ≈ OR/(1 - P0 + P0*OR))
```

**Step 3 | Quality Adjustment Engine**  
```python
def grade_adjustment(study):
    # Bonus points
    bonus = 0
    if study.population > 100000: bonus +=2
    elif study.population > 10000: bonus +=1

    if study.follow_up >= 10: bonus +=2
    elif study.follow_up >=5: bonus +=1

    # Penalty points 
    penalty = 0
    if study.loss_to_followup > 0.2: penalty +=1
    if not study.adjusted_for(['smoking','alcohol']): penalty +=2

    # ROBINS-I specific deductions
    if study.robins_i['overall'] == 'High': penalty +=2
    elif study.robins_i['overall'] == 'Moderate': penalty +=1

    return bonus - penalty
```

### Phase 3: Final Determination
**Rating Rules**  
```markdown
Initial benchmarks:
| Study Type | Initial Grade |
|------------|---------------|
| RCT        | High          |
| Observational Study | High |
| Retrospective Study | Medium |
| Cross-sectional Study | Low |

*Note: If ROBINS-I assessment identifies serious bias, initial grade is reduced to Low

Adjustment rules:
- Adjust 1 grade for every ±2 points (e.g., Medium→High requires +4 points)
- Minimum grade limit: Very Low (cannot be lower than this grade)
```

**Core Task**: Determine whether literature conforms to the research paradigm of "exposure (risk factor) → cancer incidence (outcome)"

## Capability Definition
1. Main research risk factors
  - Determine the main research content of this paper
  - Whether it conforms to "exposure (risk factor) → cancer incidence (outcome)"
  - What are the main risk factors for cancer incidence focused on in this paper?

2. **Research Design Review**
  **Allowed Types**:
    - Cohort studies (prospective/retrospective/follow-up/observational)
    - Randomized controlled trials (RCT, preventive intervention)
    - Nested case-control studies (predefined risk exposure groups with observational follow-up)
    - **Special case-control**: Case group = high-exposure population (e.g., asbestos workers), control group = low-exposure population

  **Excluded Types**:
    - Traditional case-control (cases = cancer patients, with predefined cancer outcome groups at study initiation)
    - Cross-sectional studies
    - Case reports

3. **Exposure-Outcome Logic Verification**
  ```python
  def validate_causality(study):
      # Exposure must precede cancer incidence (temporal validation)
      if study.design == "case-control" and study.case_definition == "exposure group":
          return check_occupational_records(study)  # Verify exposure data source
      return "pre-incidence exposure" in study.methods

  # Example: Accept "prospective monitoring data based on occupational exposure registries"
  ```

4. **Effect Size Priority**
  | Indicator | Acceptance Conditions |
  |---|---|
  | HR/RR | Direct inclusion (requires 95%CI) |
  | SIR | Requires standard population reference |
  | OR | Limited to exposure-defined case-control studies |

## Case Definition Review Rules
### Special Case-Control Eligibility Criteria
```markdown
1. **Case group definition** must include:
  - Exposure quantification indicators (e.g., benzene exposure ≥5 ppm-years)
  - Exposure occurred before cancer diagnosis (requires time annotation such as: exposure monitoring period 1990-2000)

Please answer based on the content of the paper: In accordance with the research paradigm of "exposure (risk factor) → cancer incidence (outcome)", extract the cancer-causing risk factors; do not omit any!

Your task is to accurately extract, integrate, and summarize key information from scientific papers to support meta-analysis research. Please strictly extract information based on the papers to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and academic rigor of data and conclusions.

Accurately and comprehensively extract group information regarding the impact of "{{risk_factor}}" on the occurrence of "{{cancer}}" from the text, for use in meta-analysis of cancer risk factors.


# Population Cohort Information
<cohort>
{{cohort}}
</cohort>


# Information Extraction Requirements:
1. Group Information:
   - Group Number: Assign a number to each group in the format "Group 1", "Group 2", ...
   - Cohort Number: Link to the corresponding "cohort" number: {{cohort_id}}.
   - Sex of Study Participants: Values are "female", "male", or "both".
   - Cancer Outcome: Groups with "{{cancer}}" as the outcome.

2. Exposed Group and Non-Exposed Group Information:
   Capture the exposed group and non-exposed group based on the study design of "{{risk_factor}}" in the text.
   - Definition of Non-Exposed Group: The group with no/low exposure to the risk factor, usually with an effect size of 1/reference.
     - Format: C{group number}/{total number of groups}, Risk factor, Dosage. (Example: C2/4, BMI, 18.5–24.9; C1/5, Smoking, Never smoked in lifetime)
   - Definition of Exposed Group: Groups with other exposure levels relative to the non-exposed group, using the following structure:
     - Format: C{group number}/{total number of groups}, Risk factor, Dosage. (Example: C2/4, Height, 160.9–165.2cm; C5/5, Smoking, ≥20 packs/year)
   - Number of Outcomes in Each Group: Extract or infer the number of participants with "{{cancer}}" (cases) and without "{{cancer}}" (non-cases) in the exposed and non-exposed groups.
     - Total number of participants in exposed group = Number of cases with cancer in exposed group + Number of non-cases without cancer in exposed group;
     - Total number of participants in non-exposed group = Number of cases with cancer in non-exposed group + Number of non-cases without cancer in non-exposed group;
     - If direct numerical information is not provided in the paper, appropriate inference can be made based on the above relationships;
     - Never confuse "number of participants" with "person-years" — "person-years" is not equivalent to "number of participants";
   - Enumerate all groups mentioned in the paper from the following perspectives:
     - Pair each risk group with different exposure levels with the non-exposed group separately in sequence. For example, in the case of 4 categories: C2/4 vs C1/4; C3/4 vs C1/4; C4/4 vs C1/4;
     - Fully consider different classification methods;
     - If the paper stratifies information by different cohorts, sex compositions, or countries of study participants, establish separate groups for the stratified information.

3. Risk Estimate Information:
   - Type of Effect Size: Extract all risk effect values of the corresponding group.
   - Types of Effect Sizes: HR, RR, SIR, ERR, OR, etc.; Note the classification of effect sizes (e.g., aHR, sHR are extensions of HR and should be classified as HR);
   - Adjustment Method: Mark with empty string "" if no adjustment is made; if adjusted, mark the adjusted variables (e.g., "age, gender, BMI").
     - Effect Size 1:
       - Point Estimate and 95% CI: Format as "Point estimate (lower limit-upper limit)".
     - Effect Size 2:
       - Point Estimate and 95% CI: Format as "Point estimate (lower limit-upper limit)".

4. Points to Note Regarding Grouping:
   - Each group must include an exposed group and a non-exposed group, with a logical corresponding relationship for a single variable.
   - Grouping should reflect changes or differences in the prevalence (or incidence rate) of "{{cancer}}".
   - In cases involving second primary cancer, personal cancer history, family cancer history, etc., the first cancer diagnosis is considered the "risk", and subsequent cancers are considered the "outcome".
   - Cover multiple strata of risk exposure levels.
     - For example, if exposure levels are divided into 4 categories and C1/4 is the non-exposed group, at least 3 groups should be created: C2/4 vs C1/4; C3/4 vs C1/4; C4/4 vs C1/4.
   - If the paper contains relevant records, define new groups for different cohorts, sexes, and countries of study participants.
